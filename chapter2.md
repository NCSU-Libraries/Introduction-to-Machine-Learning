## Knowing Your Data

You will create a dataset called `emp_data` having two attributes - earnings and s_ratings and 20 observations

emp_data = Employee dataset

earnings = What each employee earns in dollars per day

s_ratings = how satisfied the employee is with his/her wage

From this dataset, we will try to predict a new employee's satisfaction rating when he is paid $200, $400, or $1200 per day.
So, earnings is the predictor and s_ratings is the class we'll predict.

This exercise uses just one attribute for prediction and that is employeeâ€™s `earnings`. 

It is Machine learning practice to partition dataset for analysis into Training and Test sets.

The training set could be 60 - 70% of the entire dataset while the test set is the percentage remaining.


*** =instructions
- Check out the structure of `movie_selection`.
- Select movies with a rating of 5 or higher. Assign the result to `good_movies`.
- Use `plot()` to  plot `good_movies$Run` on the x-axis, `good_movies$Rating` on the y-axis and set `col` to `good_movies$Genre`.

*** =hint
- Use `str()` for the first instruction.
- For the second instruction, you should use `...[movie_selection$Rating >= 5, ]`.
- For the plot, use `plot(x = ..., y = ..., col = ...)`.

```{r}

# Check out the structure of movie_selection


# Select movies that have a rating of 5 or higher: good_movies


# Plot Run (i.e. run time) on the x axis, Rating on the y axis, and set the color using Genre
